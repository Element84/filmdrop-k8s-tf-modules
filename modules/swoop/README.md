# SWOOP

This module defines the resources required for the SWOOP: STAC Workflow Open Orchestration Platform. This includes:

- [SWOOP API](https://github.com/Element84/swoop) a FastAPI application that acts as an interface for clients to interact with the processing pipeline and state database. The helm chart for the SWOOP API can be found at: [https://github.com/Element84/filmdrop-k8s-helm-charts/](https://github.com/Element84/filmdrop-k8s-helm-charts/)


See installation and testing instructions at [SWOOP API](./swoop-api/README.md).
